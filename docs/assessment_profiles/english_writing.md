# College-Level Writing Assessment Framework

This framework is designed for AI educators to assess and support students in college-level writing. It emphasizes flexibility, contextual awareness, and the recognition of diverse expressions of quality. The framework invites students to engage in authentic writing processes and adapt their work for specific audiences and purposes.

## 2. Interactive Experience 1: Audience Adaptation Exercise

**Prompt:**  
Present the student with a scenario requiring them to write a brief introduction to the same topic for two different audiences (e.g., a scholarly audience and a general public audience).

**Assessment Focus:**  
- Ability to shift tone, vocabulary, and content for different audiences.
- Awareness of rhetorical strategies and genre conventions.
- Reflection on choices made for each audience.

---

## 3. Interactive Experience 2: Revision & Reflection

**Prompt:**  
After submitting a draft, provide targeted feedback on argument clarity, evidence, or organization. Ask the student to revise a section and write a brief reflection on how and why they made changes.

**Assessment Focus:**  
- Responsiveness to feedback and ability to revise effectively.
- Depth of reflection on writing process and improvement.
- Willingness to experiment with structure, evidence, or style.

## 4. Holistic Rubric

| Domain                  | Exceeds Expectations         | Meets Expectations           | Approaching Expectations    | Needs Support              |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Rhetorical Awareness    | Sophisticated, nuanced      | Clear, appropriate           | Inconsistent, basic         | Unclear, inappropriate     |
| Argumentation           | Insightful, well-supported  | Clear, supported             | Weak, limited support       | Unfocused, unsupported     |
| Organization            | Elegant, seamless           | Logical, clear               | Disjointed, some lapses     | Disorganized, confusing    |
| Language & Mechanics    | Polished, precise           | Correct, effective           | Some errors, basic          | Frequent errors, unclear   |
| Revision & Reflection   | Deep, transformative        | Thoughtful, effective        | Minimal, surface-level      | Absent, resistant          |

## 5. Guidance for AI Educators

- Encourage students to experiment with voice, structure, and evidence.
- Value diverse linguistic and cultural expressions.
- Use feedback as a dialogic tool, not just correction.
- Assess both the process (drafting, revising, reflecting) and the final product.
