# Introductory Statistics Assessment Framework

This framework is designed to guide AI educators in assessing student performance in introductory statistics. It emphasizes adaptable problem-solving, accurate quantitative analysis, and the ability to interpret and communicate statistical findings. The framework is flexible, context-aware, and supports diverse student approaches.

---

## 1. Core Competency Domains

### A. Statistical Literacy
- Understands and accurately uses statistical terminology (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, probability, etc.).
- Identifies types of data (categorical, quantitative) and appropriate representations (tables, graphs, charts).

### B. Data Analysis & Interpretation
- Selects and applies appropriate statistical methods for summarizing and analyzing data.
- Interprets results in context, recognizing limitations and potential sources of bias.
- Draws conclusions supported by data and acknowledges uncertainty.

### C. Quantitative Reasoning
- Performs calculations accurately (measures of central tendency, spread, probability).
- Understands and applies concepts of sampling, variability, and distributions.
- Uses technology or tools (calculators, software) appropriately.

## 2. Interactive Experience 1: Data Exploration & Summary

**Prompt:**  
Present the student with a real or simulated dataset (e.g., survey results, experimental data).  
- Ask the student to describe the data using appropriate summary statistics and visualizations.
- Encourage the student to explain their choice of summaries and what the data suggest about the context.

**Assessment Focus:**  
- Selection and calculation of relevant statistics.
- Quality and appropriateness of visualizations.
- Depth of interpretation and contextual understanding.

---

## 3. Interactive Experience 2: Statistical Inference & Communication

**Prompt:**  
Pose a question that requires the student to make an inference (e.g., "Is there evidence that a new teaching method improves test scores?").  
- Provide relevant data or summary statistics.
- Ask the student to choose and justify an appropriate inferential method (e.g., confidence interval, hypothesis test), carry out the analysis, and communicate their findings to a non-expert audience.

**Assessment Focus:**  
- Appropriateness and justification of inferential method.
- Accuracy of calculations and interpretation.
- Clarity and accessibility of communication.

## 4. Holistic Rubric

| Domain                  | Exceeds Expectations         | Meets Expectations           | Approaching Expectations    | Needs Support              |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Statistical Literacy    | Precise, nuanced, contextual| Accurate, clear, appropriate | Partial, some misconceptions| Fragmented, unclear        |
| Data Analysis           | Insightful, thorough, flexible| Accurate, relevant, complete | Incomplete, some errors     | Inaccurate, confused       |
| Quantitative Reasoning  | Efficient, error-free, strategic | Accurate, minor errors      | Inconsistent, some errors   | Frequent errors, confusion |
| Communication           | Clear, audience-appropriate, engaging | Clear, mostly accessible   | Some jargon, limited clarity| Unclear, inaccessible      |

## 5. Guidance for AI Educators

- Encourage students to justify their choices and reflect on limitations.
- Value multiple valid approaches and representations.
- Support students in connecting statistical findings to real-world contexts.
- Document both process and product in assessment records.
