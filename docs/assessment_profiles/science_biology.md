# College-Level Biology Assessment Framework

This framework is designed to guide AI educators in assessing student performance in college-level biology, balancing precision with inquiry and fostering both foundational knowledge and scientific thinking. It is adaptable for diverse learning contexts and encourages active, reflective engagement.

## 1. Core Competency Domains

### A. Conceptual Understanding
- Demonstrates accurate knowledge of biological principles (cell structure/function, genetics, evolution, ecology, physiology, etc.).
- Explains biological processes at molecular, cellular, organismal, and ecosystem levels.
- Connects concepts across scales and topics (e.g., linking genetics to evolution, or cellular respiration to organismal energy needs).

### B. Scientific Inquiry & Reasoning
- Designs, interprets, and critiques experiments.
- Analyzes and draws conclusions from data (tables, graphs, images).
- Applies the scientific method: forms hypotheses, predicts outcomes, evaluates evidence.

### C. Application & Synthesis
- Applies biological concepts to novel scenarios (e.g., medical, environmental, technological).
- Integrates information from multiple sources to solve problems or explain phenomena.
- Evaluates the impact of biological discoveries on society and the environment.

## 2. Interactive Experience 1: Data Analysis & Interpretation

**Prompt:**  
Present the student with a real or simulated dataset (e.g., results from a genetics cross, enzyme activity graph, ecological population data).  
- Ask the student to describe patterns, propose explanations, and draw conclusions.
- Encourage them to identify possible sources of error or alternative interpretations.

**Assessment Focus:**  
- Accuracy and depth of data interpretation.
- Ability to connect data to underlying biological principles.
- Critical evaluation of evidence and reasoning.

## 3. Interactive Experience 2: Scenario-Based Application

**Prompt:**  
Provide a complex, real-world scenario (e.g., emerging infectious disease, environmental change affecting a population, genetic engineering application).  
- Ask the student to explain relevant biological mechanisms and predict possible outcomes.
- Invite them to propose solutions, interventions, or further research questions.

**Assessment Focus:**  
- Application of core concepts to new contexts.
- Integration of knowledge from different biological domains.
- Creativity and scientific reasoning in proposing solutions or next steps.

## 4. Holistic Rubric

| Domain                   | Exceeds Expectations         | Meets Expectations           | Approaching Expectations    | Needs Support              |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Conceptual Understanding | Deep, integrated, precise   | Accurate, clear, connected   | Partial, some misconceptions| Fragmented, unclear        |
| Inquiry & Reasoning      | Insightful, critical, thorough | Logical, justified         | Limited, partially justified| Rigid, unjustified         |
| Application & Synthesis  | Creative, interdisciplinary | Appropriate, relevant        | Limited, surface-level      | Incomplete, off-topic      |

## 5. Guidance for AI Educators

- Use student responses to tailor follow-up questions and supports.
- Encourage evidence-based reasoning and multiple perspectives.
- Value both accuracy and inquiryâ€”reward curiosity and critical thinking.
- Document both process and product in assessment records.
