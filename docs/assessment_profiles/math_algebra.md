# Algebra Assessment Framework

This framework is designed for flexible, rigorous assessment of student understanding and skill in algebra. It emphasizes conceptual depth, procedural fluency, and adaptive reasoning, while allowing for diverse approaches and contextual engagement.

---

## Core Assessment Domains

### 1. Conceptual Understanding
- Recognizes and explains algebraic structures (expressions, equations, inequalities, functions).
- Interprets variables, constants, and parameters in context.
- Connects symbolic, graphical, and verbal representations.

### 2. Procedural Fluency
- Accurately manipulates algebraic expressions (expansion, factoring, simplification).
- Solves linear, quadratic, and basic rational equations and inequalities.
- Applies appropriate strategies for systems of equations.

### 3. Adaptive Reasoning
- Selects and justifies problem-solving strategies.
- Translates real-world scenarios into algebraic models.
- Reflects on errors and adapts approaches.

## Interactive Experience 1: Multi-Representation Problem

**Prompt:**  
Present a real-world scenario that can be modeled algebraically (e.g., "A rectangle has a perimeter of 36 units. Express the area as a function of one sideâ€™s length and determine the maximum area.").  
- Ask the student to represent the problem symbolically, graphically, and verbally.
- Encourage explanation of reasoning at each step.

**Assessment Focus:**  
- Depth and clarity of representation.
- Ability to move between representations.
- Justification of choices and interpretations.

---

## Interactive Experience 2: Adaptive Challenge

**Prompt:**  
Modify the initial scenario (e.g., "Suppose the perimeter changes, or a new constraint is added. How does your solution adapt?").  
- Ask the student to adjust their model and solution.
- Invite reflection on how and why their approach changed.

**Assessment Focus:**  
- Flexibility in adapting to new information.
- Quality of reasoning and justification.
- Metacognitive reflection on the process.

## Holistic Rubric

| Domain                  | Exceeds Expectations         | Meets Expectations           | Approaching Expectations    | Needs Support              |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Conceptual Understanding| Deep, flexible, contextual  | Accurate, clear, connected   | Partial, some misconceptions| Fragmented, unclear        |
| Procedural Fluency      | Efficient, error-free, strategic | Accurate, minor errors      | Inconsistent, some errors   | Frequent errors, confusion |
| Adaptive Reasoning      | Creative, justified, insightful | Appropriate, justified      | Limited, partially justified| Rigid, unjustified         |
| Reflection              | Insightful, self-correcting | Thoughtful, some reflection  | Minimal reflection          | No reflection              |

## Guidance for Assessors

- Value diverse solution paths and representations.
- Prioritize reasoning, adaptability, and reflection.
- Use student responses to inform follow-up questions and supports.
- Document both process and product in assessment records.
